ESCAPE THE MAZE

Escape the maze is a first person, single player game developed in Unity3D using version 2021.3.26f1

The game consist of a maze structure and the goal of the player is to navigate through the maze and reach the end. In between the navigation enemies will pop up. Each hit by them will reduce your health by 10 units
If health reaches 0, its Game Over
To help the player navigate through the maze, a hint button is provided which highlights the path to the end but it only remains highlighted for 15 seconds

This is my first large scale Unity Project. All the assets and materials have been taken from the Asset Store

The highlighting of the pathway is done using Unity's built-in NavMesh library. In order to install it go to Windows -> Package Manager -> Search for AI Navigation and install it.

The enemy programming is done using Behavior Tree concepts.

The game is inspired by Alan Wake and Outlast 

How To Play:
1. Used WASD keys for movement
2. Press F to switch on flashlight
3. Use Key E to open doors
